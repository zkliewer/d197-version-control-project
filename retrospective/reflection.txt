How the merge conflict was resolved:
I created a conflict by editing the same line of README.md on both the main and feature-test branches. When I attempted to merge the branches, Git flagged the conflict. I resolved the conflict by manually editing the file to include a combined version of both edits. After reviewing the changes, I staged and committed the resolved file to complete the merge.

Three changes I made:
1. Created and edited about.txt with project details for D197.
2. Created a new branch (feature-test) and edited README.md with a message specific to that branch.
3. Introduced and resolved a merge conflict by editing the same file in both branches and finalizing the merge manually.
